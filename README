******************

What is The Matrix?

TheMatrix is an XML datastore plugin for GetSimple 3.1
It allows you to define tables, which user defined fields which you can then query using SQL 
type queries to retrive the date for you theme/plugin

The plugin can be used standalone or you can build your plugin around it using it to store your data. 

As of now we support the following field types:

o - int, integer, used for ID field
o - text, normal text box
o - textlong, full width Text Box
o - Checkbox, Checkbox.
o - slug, add a slug & title to the table
o - pages, a dropdown of the current Pages. 
o - templates, a dropdown of the current templates
o - dropdown, a dropdown from another table. 
o - datepicker, a date picker field. 
o - datetimepicker, a date and time picker. 
o - image, an image selector field
o - filepicker, a file selector field
o - textarea, a plain textarea
o - codeeditor, a codemirror textarea
o - texteditor, a CKEditor enabled textarea. 

Each field has the following options: 

o - label, short label displayed on the field entry screen
o - description, a full description for the end user as to what the field does. 
o - tableview, whether to display the field on the record view screen. 
o - cachindex, whether to return the field using sql queries of return it by accessing the file directly, 
	this will be used primarily for large type fields (textareas etc..) which may hold large amount of data 
	which should not be loaded into memory. 

So you setup your Tables, add some fields and input data into those fields. 

The front end allows you to run SQL type queries on the data to build your webpages. 

So what can you use it for ?

Anything !!
Blogs, comment systems, banners, galleries,Lists, Price lists... you name it you can do it... 

Example

To setup a simple Blog, set up a new table "blog" 
add the following fields, 

o - title, textlong 
o - author, text
o - publisheddate, datepicker 
o - content, texteditor

Enter some date. 

On your template use getSchemaTable to return the records from a table to an array ; 

	$blog=getSchemaTable('blog');  // 
	
prepare the SQL query 

	$sql=new sql4array();

Run the query on the array , 
** note ** the FROM clause specifies the array you have defined above and not the real table name. 

	$blog = $sql->query('select id,title,author,publishdate,content from blog ORDER by publishdate DESC');

You then have your array of data from the 'blog' table sorted by 'publisheddate' to output and style as you wish...
